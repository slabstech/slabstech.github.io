Reinforcement learning to secure code bases

Load testing on Api end-points using SwaggerUi and test containers .
No-code testing using CI/CD actions.
Provide metrics on

1. Available API and time taken for end-to-end
2. Memory usage - generate heap dump , analyze heap dump(exists)
3. With fuzzer find code issues, with rapid data generation
4. Code coverage + SonarLint (exists)
5. Generate Missing code-
   * Provide feature code to ChatGPT to generate missing test code 
   * use sonar lint (exists) as prompt to LLM
