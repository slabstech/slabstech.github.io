Autonomous Construction Engineering in Mars Environment

* Objective : Occupy Mars

* Use Case : How will humans settle in a hostile environment ?

That's where "ACE-MARS" come to the picture, building the basic blocks for survival.

* History : Relive the Space Race since Sputnik in 21st century

* SOA : Starship, New Shepard, Mangalyaan, Chinese Mission

* Ideas

    * Wall Prefabrication & Setup

    * Solar Rooftop : Transmission and installation

    * 3D printing - cutting edge, brick & kiln low cost using existing

    * Block Extraction - hyperloop, boring company by elon musk

    * Underground Travel

    * Survey for Land
        * Exploration
        * Nutrient/Soil Testing

    * Map of Mars
        * Current Active Robots
        * Previous Landed Robots
        * Max. Solar Irradiation
        * Water Exploration - possible ways of collections

    * Swarm Machines
        * Send them a year ahead of human arrival and build critical infrastructure.
            * for Human Habitation
            * Solar Panels - Power Generation
            * Underground Travel
            * Mineral Extraction & Geothermal Extraction
            * Terrestrial exploration and formation
            * Communication Development
                * Old Style - Mirror & Radios
                * Till next batch of experiments arrive for satellite deployment
            * Landing Pads Creation

* Planning
    * City planning and Zoning, Starting from a clean slate from Sim City
    * Mapping Terrain and Weather Conditions
    * Transportation for workers, engineers
    * Energy Generation & Transmission
    * Local resources exploration for in-situ development.
